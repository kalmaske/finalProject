# Aggrandize..

Project Overview & Motivation..

     - Aggrandize is a beacon for those suffering from depression and mental illness. 

     - It gives freedom of expression to users in need of liberating their innermost turmoil in a multitude of platforms. 

     - It allows users to showcase poetry, short stories, photography, originally composed music, mini films, and video through social media and an aggregate website.

     - The application gives those voice who would otherwise stifle their muse and remain disjointed from the staggering population languishing from mental illness. 

     - The ingenuity of the application stems from its ability to platform creative expression, encourage and support connection among users, raises awareness of mental illness, and boons a healthy means to tackle pernicious emotions.
